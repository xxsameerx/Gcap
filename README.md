## 📖 About The Project

**GCAP (Government Consultation Analytics Platform)** is a revolutionary web application designed to modernize how government institutions conduct public consultations and analyze citizen feedback.

### 🎯 Problem We Solve

- **Manual Processing Bottleneck**: Traditional consultations struggle with processing thousands of citizen responses
- **Language Barriers**: India's linguistic diversity creates communication challenges
- **Lack of Real-time Insights**: Delayed analysis prevents timely policy adjustments
- **Poor User Experience**: Outdated interfaces reduce citizen participation

### 💡 Our Solution

GCAP addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent, accessible, and culturally sensitive platform that transforms how governments engage with citizens.
